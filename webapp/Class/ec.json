{"lyrics":"Mm-mm, yeah\r\nMm-mm\r\nIn the dead of the night, I have these dreams\r\nWhat'll happen to me? Will I burn out?\r\nHave I been wrong? What does it mean?\n\nAll these things, can't understand why\n\nSay something's wrong with me, I know\n\nBy myself alone driving, I go\n\nFull moon as it glows, I search for truth\n\nTryna be brand new, yeah, I will try\n\nNo, I won't do but through these screams\n\nFighting and bleed, blood in my eye\n\nAnd I'll be another broken soul\n\nGod save me (Yeah)\n\n\n\nYeah, baby, see I'm back in my zone\n\nJust what I need, mama (Yeah)\n\nNigga been in hell, the same ol'\n\nOn a mission and I'm gonna fly high (High)\n\nThis for the sad pеople who keep the blunt burning and we\n\nOff on a journеy, you learn me\n\n\n\nClose call, life on the edge\n\nAhh, when the time comes, I'll find peace\n\nStill in search of, nights, I'm sittin' wishin'\n\nI can find love in me\n\nLettin' go, ooh, this ain't livin'\n\nI swim in pain\n\nNever drown, keep my head up above the waves (Get it, get it)\n\nTired of runnin', I won't run from fate\n\nLate night, ooh, this is when I come alive, when the dreams made\n\nTake me, ooh, just don't leave, babe\n\nCome on, woah (Don't say goodnight)\n\nScars on my heart, woah (Ahh, ahh, ahh, yeah)\n\n\n\nYeah, baby, see you're back in my zone\n\nJust what I need, mama (Yeah)\n\nNigga been in hell, the same road\n\nOn a mission and I'm gonna fly high\n\nThis for the sad people who keep the blunt burning in me\n\nOff on a journey, you learn me"}
